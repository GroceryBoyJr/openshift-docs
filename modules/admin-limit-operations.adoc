= Limit range operations

== Creating a limit range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a limit range object definition with the required specifications.

. Create a limit range object definition with your required specifications.

.Procedure

. Create the object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file> -n <project>
----

== View the limit

You can view any limit ranges that are defined in a project by navigating in the web console to the *Quota* page for the project. You can also use the CLI to view limit range details by performing the following steps:

.Procedure

. Get the list of limit range objects that are defined in the project. For example, a project called `demoproject``:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get limits -n demoproject
----
+
.Example Output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME              AGE
resource-limits   6d
----

. Describe the limit range. For example, for a limit range called *resource-limits*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe limits resource-limits -n demoproject
----
+
.Example Output
+
[source,terminal]
----

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete limits <limit_name>
