toc::[]

A resource quota, defined by a `ResourceQuota` object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

Using quotas and limit ranges, cluster administrators can set constraints to limit the number of objects or amount of compute resources that are used in your project. This helps cluster administrators better manage and allocate resources across all projects, and ensure that no projects are using more than is appropriate for the cluster size.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Quotas are set by cluster administrators and are scoped to a given project. {product-title} project owners can change quotas for their project, but not limit ranges. {product-title} users cannot modify quotas or limit ranges.
====

The following sections help you understand how to check on your quota and limit range settings, what sorts of things they can constrain, and how you can request or limit compute resources in your own pods and containers.
